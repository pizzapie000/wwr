        <p>Hey everyone! I'm Byron Bursett and I am from Bakersfield California! It is a pretty big town with a lot to do but it is always hot there. There are lots of great mountains, beaches, and theme parks nearby that make up for it.</p>
        <p>I have quite a few different hobbies and skills that I have pursued. One of my favorites is music. I play the drums, clarinet, ocarina, recorder, and even a little piano. I also absolutely love singing and I take any opportunity I can to sing</p>
        <p>I have been a member of the church for my whole life, but I have had some incredible experiences before, during, and after my mission that really grew my testimony and made me into the person I am today. One of my all time favorite quotes is this one from President Nelson: “In coming days, we will see the greatest manifestations of the Savior's power that the world has ever seen. Between now and the time he returns 'with power and great glory,' he will bestow countless privileges, blessings and miracles upon the faithful.” This quote reminds me that God has a plan for us even when times are dark and hardships happen. I know that God will always bless us and I am always amazed by the miracles I see in my life</p>
        <p>Aside from that I am just grateful to be here in this course. I love computers and learning about how they work. I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science and hope to solve problems and use technology to make things more efficient. I'm also really excited to get to know y'all</p>
